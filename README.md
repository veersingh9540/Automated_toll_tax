# vehicle survelliance solution **AUTOMATED

Ongoing project on Image processing . using python/java/php/Mysql to make the whole toll tax system automated
this project works as Follows :-
1) We planned to use image text recognition to scan the vehicle no.
2) After scanning system will ask the questions such as **one_way,two_way,destination then according to that system generates money command**
3) then QR code is shown for the payment money.


NOTE **if the vehicle number cannot be scanned. then the vehicle number plate is not legal then the driver will have to enter the car no manually with his photo captured and he is fines according to the legal law for RTO.**

The user interface will look like this 

I used OpenCV , pytesseract, Thresholding as algorithm for making the text recognition 
tinkter is used as GUI its in Beta now i'm working on the designs 
**If you guys can sujjest some GUI or program changes. I Do appreciate that **
